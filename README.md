Wordle Machine Learned Solver

Done for a Machine Learning class in university, decided to solve wordle by calculating a best initial first word using entropy,
then figuring out the next best word by repeating the same process. Afterwards, the full algorithm is used to guess the remaining
best words using the entropy method. It has roughly a 99% success rate, at least one actual possible word fails to be guessed in 6,
but I atm do not know which word it is shrug.
